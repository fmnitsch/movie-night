# Movie Night

A personal project to help users search for and save their top-5 movies to a watch list. Built using React and using calls to the OMDB Api (http://www.omdbapi.com/).

Makes use of:

- Responsive search function that updates as the user is typing
- Saving state to local storage so movie picks aren't loss when navigating away
- Microinteractions to improve accessibility and user experience
- Clean aesthetic design
